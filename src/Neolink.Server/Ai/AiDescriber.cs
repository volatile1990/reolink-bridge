/// snapshot command is sampled — the Baichuan snap serves the low-res
/// sub-stream image, so no server-side video decoding is ever needed. The

/// remainder: sampling continues at one frame per second, and whenever the
/// budget fills, every other stored tail frame is dropped and the interval
/// doubles. The final set is the dense opening, frames spanning the entire
/// tail (a person leaving 30s in tells a different story than the first 10s),
/// plus the rolling closing window (see <see cref="ClosingSeconds"/>), stays
/// within budget, and each frame remembers when it was taken so the model
