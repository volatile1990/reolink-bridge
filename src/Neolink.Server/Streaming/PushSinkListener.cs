/// DNS-override wake hints for battery cameras: Neolink itself plays the Reolink
/// push service. The user adds a DNS override on their router (or Pi-hole /
/// AdGuard) so pushx.reolink.com resolves to the Neolink host; on a PIR event the
/// camera "delivers" its phone push here, and the mere TCP connection is an
/// instant, event-grade wake signal — no firewall logging or syslog required, so
/// it works on routers (OpenWRT and friends) the filterlog path can't cover.
///
/// The connection is accepted and closed immediately: nothing here speaks TLS or
/// the push protocol — the attempt IS the signal, exactly like the firewall-log
/// path treats a BLOCK rule. Consequence the docs spell out: the real push never
/// reaches Reolink, so app notifications on the phone stop for cameras behind
/// the override; Neolink → Home Assistant becomes the notification channel.
///
/// TCP ONLY, deliberately: the camera's post-wake p2p re-registration bursts are
/// UDP, so even if a user over-broad DNS override (a reolink.com wildcard —
/// docs say don't) lands that chatter on this host, a TCP-only sink stays
/// silent and the park/hint loop the syslog filter guards against can't start.
