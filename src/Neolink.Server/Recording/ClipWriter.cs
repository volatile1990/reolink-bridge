/// <summary>
/// Writes hub media packets into a fragmented-MP4 file (playable by browsers and
/// ffmpeg alike). Same pacing trick as the live web player: a camera buffer's true
/// duration is only known when the NEXT buffer arrives (RTP delta), so one buffer
/// is held back and its measured delta spread evenly across its frames.
/// AAC audio is recorded as track 2 when the camera has it; ADPCM cameras record
/// video-only (raw PCM in MP4 is unplayable in browsers).
///
/// Disk I/O is fully decoupled from the caller: fragments are muxed on the
/// caller's thread but written by a dedicated background thread (below-normal
/// priority, never a thread-pool thread) behind a bounded memory budget. A slow
/// disk — HDD flush stalls, spun-down drives, network shares — can therefore
/// never block the media pipeline or starve the thread pool that live streaming
/// runs on. When the disk falls behind the budget, recorded frames are dropped
/// (with a warning) and writing resumes at the next keyframe.
///
/// While recording, the file is a live-style fragmented MP4 (crash-safe: every
/// flushed fragment is durable). That shape is terrible to SEEK over HTTP,
/// though: one moof per frame means a browser must range-request its way
/// through thousands of tiny headers to build an index — instant on localhost,
/// tens of seconds across a network. So when the clip closes it is finalized
/// IN PLACE into a classic indexed MP4: a moov with full sample tables (built
/// from offsets tracked during writing — no data is copied or moved) is
/// appended, every moof is retyped to a skippable "free" box, and lastly the
/// fragmented header up front is retired the same way. Players then seek by
/// byte offset with two or three range requests, like any ordinary MP4. A
/// crash at any point leaves a playable fragmented file; if the classic
/// finalize fails, the old fallback (duration patch + mfra keyframe index)
/// keeps the file usable. Finalization happens on the writer thread after
/// <see cref="Dispose"/>; await <see cref="Completion"/> to observe it.
